Glad to have you here. My name is Juan, and this is my blog.

In Spanish we have this word, _batiburrillo_, that refers to a mix of unrelated stuff put together. This blog is that.

Here you will find links to [essays and unpolished notes](../posts/essays), [fictions](../posts/fiction/), and [technical projects](../posts/projects/) I'd like to share.

If you want to see more of my writings, [this is my Substack](https://participes.substack.com/).

If you want to see more of my projects, [this is my Github](https://github.com/jjuanramos/).
