This is a short story inspired by the cover of Robert Kegan's book [The Evolving Self](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345095.The_Evolving_Self).

At the time, I was struggling with how one can resolve the tension between being and becoming, between accepting oneself while at the same time striving to be something more.

What came out is death, repulsion, and transformation, amidst a landscape where the possibility of blood is ever present.

Anyways! [Here's the piece](https://participes.substack.com/p/the-becoming-self), hope you like it :).
