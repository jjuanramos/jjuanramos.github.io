			<p>Nowadays, I am starting to see commitment as the practice of letting go of the fantasy of utter certainty: that we&rsquo;re ever going to find something that fully satisfies us, leaving no room for doubt, or regret.</p>
<p>I, too, am skeptical of rationality: I grew out of love with it during my early-twenties, when I started to realize how often it failed to make sense of reality and to fully capture whatever was really going on. It was disappointing to see how it came up short at providing a path to a meaningful life.</p>
<p>So, prudent as I am, I started to go all-in on feeling<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: where my gut points to, there shall I go. If being rational wasn&rsquo;t capable of solving this deep unsatisfaction that brew within, then feelings just might. Reason would then be secluded to intelectually justify the decision that was made on a whim in the first place. Moreover, if there were any tension between them, I would prioritize feelings everytime. Gut was now my compass.</p>
<p>The gut can be erratic and whimsical, though: it wants what it wants, and it doesn&rsquo;t held accountability about it. Thus, I went on exploring anything and everything: a loop of trying something out, being tempted by something else, dropping the first thing, trying that new thing instead, and repeat. &ldquo;Curious&rdquo; is a word that people have frequently used to describe me. It&rsquo;s often hard to draw the line between curiosity and naivety, between interestedness and directionlessness.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I can&rsquo;t help but recognize how deeply confused the underlying force that moved me was. Basically, what I didn&rsquo;t have shone brighter on its potentiality than anything I possessed, whose shadows were amplified by the light of actuality. The weight of what I could be missing invaded my body and, lacking the will or strength, maybe the tools, culminated in me surrendering more often than not. Feelings of groundlessness and frustration were common; looking for the next thing, routine. At work, people would admire how I was always on the forefront of tools and methodologies, but it was not improving the business nor my technical skills that motivated me, but rather a rush to find something new, something <em>definitive</em>.</p>
<p>Deep down, I know this search stemmed from a feeling of inherent specialness. Even though I never worded it like that before, and would have denied it if you threw it at me, I guess it&rsquo;s fair to say I believed on some kind of causality, or destiny, or cosmic plan -whatever you want to call it-. That I deserved something great just for the sake of being. And that made me a seeker. I yearned for a passion waiting to be found, a theory to be revealed that would give all life meaning, a person meant for me. I convinced myself it was only a matter of looking harder: hope transformed into an insatiable thirst for completeness, to fulfil what was missing. That&rsquo;s why reason didn&rsquo;t play a role here: reason does not tell you when your thirst has been satiated, your body does. That was knowledge that couldn&rsquo;t be put into words. And so, I thought my body would know when the time came.</p>
<p>I quitted my job like six months ago, and that&rsquo;s given me plenty of time to focus on the Search. And I would lie if I said I haven&rsquo;t found anything. I have. Just not what I expected.</p>
<p>What I found is hopelessness. That is, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a discovery waiting for me that will transform reality, and make it more vivid, brighter, and meaningful, any longer. I accept I won&rsquo;t ever stop questioning the choices I made: stuff I didn&rsquo;t choose will recurrently look attractive. The possibility of getting it wrong will remain all-pervasive and irresolvable. Complete, final satisfaction (i.e. the &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; trope) is straight-up a fantasy. Passion seems bullshit now, and uncertainty the only thing we can take for granted.</p>
<p>I know this comes out as nihilistic and sad, but I find it powerful. This quote has been popping up in my mind lately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will, from <a href="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft538nb2x9&amp;chunk.id=d0e6265&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress">Romain Rolland</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I kind of agree, as hopelessness seems like a fertile ground to build on top of: it provides serenity and sobriety, a way of seeing things as-they-are that can lead to conducive acting. Hope, on the other hand, comes accross as a rejection of reality: an evitative pattern towards uncertainty that is sedative and dumbing, and prevents action.</p>
<p>Hopelessness doesn&rsquo;t mean that life sucks, it just means that there&rsquo;s nothing waiting for you. That doesn&rsquo;t compromise the possibility of enjoyment: we can still dance.</p>
<p>Then, depth<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> becomes utterly attractive and valuable: depth enables mastery, and mastery facilitates enjoyment. Depth, however, cannot be shortcutted. And that&rsquo;s why commitment is essential.</p>
<p>Hope is felt strongly. It&rsquo;s a fog in our head and a fire on our throat. A fire that can fuel an indiscriminate, naive curiosity with such a force it seems we can&rsquo;t help but let ourselves be propelled by its impulse, unconcerned about where it might lead us. Obviously, letting ourselves be propelled by hope everytime it arises seems like an obstacle in the pursuing of depth, as it might just launch us out of the path we choose each time, with a relentlessness worth admiring.</p>
<p>And this is where commitment comes up. Commitment is a willingness to recognize we are not mandated to act on every emotion, and we can choose. It is a reminder <strong>we can be skeptical towards the idea that feelings carry a deeper, more profound meaning</strong>.</p>
<p>Truth be told, feelings are overrated: they do not express our true selves, nor do they convey something deep within. They can provide information, that&rsquo;s all<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. There&rsquo;s no need to reify them, not even to express them at all times. There&rsquo;s nothing we must do with them, basically. Anxiety does not force you to become dysfunctional, nor joy to be stupid; FOMO doesn&rsquo;t mean you should go to that party<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: feelings are feelings, and they are here to be felt. In fact, one could argue that impulsiveness frequently arises as the reactive rejection of a feeling we don&rsquo;t want to feel<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. What I&rsquo;m trying to say here is that you don&rsquo;t have to act based on your feelings. You can do so, but <strong>you don&rsquo;t have to</strong>. I don&rsquo;t have a clue about who you are, but your feelings definitely ain&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>From that stance, commitment seems like a predisposition to re-ground. When you actually realize there is no such thing as <em>The Path</em>, you cannot help but see how many cool paths there are that you will never be able to explore, <em>if you want to get somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>It is true: choosing one path over the rest, then, might be an aesthetical reason, and that&rsquo;s it. Mostly no differences at a fundamental level. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t choose. The whole nihilist trope is that, because there is nothing deeper and meaningful about any path, there is no value on walking any of them. Afterwards, the existentialists come up and say &ldquo;hey, but if we follow our own paths, we&rsquo;ll make them meaningful&rdquo;, which is confused as well, since it still assumes a lack of meaningfulness makes things pointless, or absurd<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Paths are like gazpacho: they don&rsquo;t have to be meaningful to be enjoyable.</p>
<p>So, the point of commitment is not a blind faith towards what is, but a healthy skepticism towards what we <em>think</em> are missing. When a strong desire for change, or a sudden flow of insatisfaction, comes up, we can poke it with an analytical, pessimistic stick. We learn to rely on hopelessness: the recognition of no deeper meanings, no fate, no passion, no other half, no nothing. However, we remain aware nothing I just mentioned is a requirement for enjoyment, and that commiting to a given path might make that beautiful, passionate enjoyment more available. And from there, we choose.</p>
<p>Against any shiny and new path, then, commitment has a bias to ask: <em>is this actually true? does this take me where I want to go? why should I choose this path over the one I already chose?</em> These questions might be useful at reminding us why we chose what we did on the first place, and to properly evaluate it against whatever is coming up<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I was skeptical of rationality, and now I&rsquo;m skeptical of emotions, too. If you want to know what I will become skeptical of in the future, please subscribe.</p>

<p>Feelings as the subjective interpretation of emotions. Example: &ldquo;This knot in my gut means I must do X about Y&rdquo;.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>See what I did there? Also, existentialism leads to absurdism for another reason: meaning has to be shared to have any value, that&rsquo;s why &ldquo;creating our own realities&rdquo; does not work in practice. We are also limited by biological, social, and cultural boundaries, and ignoring that leads nowhere.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>If you are like me, though, you will find it pretty easy to justify most decisions. If so, I recommend you to remain choiceless for as long as you can. Just stick to something.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
