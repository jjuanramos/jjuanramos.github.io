			<p>Some time has passed by since I first started exploring Vajrayana buddhism, explicitly the flavour instilled by David Chapman&rsquo;s <a href="https://vividness.live/">Vividness</a>.</p>
<p>As many others, I originally found it through his main site, <a href="https://meaningness.com/">Meaningness</a>, which is still my main recommendation to anyone that find themselves on a confused place with regards to what&rsquo;s the actual meaning of life, their purpose here, and everything else.</p>
<p>Back to Vajrayana, I find it to be a worldview that is exceptionally fruitful for those of us that get overwhelmed by the infinite amount of ways of being and acting that are preached upon on the internet. <a href="https://vividness.live/principles-and-functions">Its systematical approach towards practices</a>, where the principles they are based on and the function they are supposed to serve are brung to the front, has been incredibly useful to remain from jumping into the next current cool thing: if you are able to evaluate those principles and fuctions against Vajrayana&rsquo;s, it becomes much easier to discard the stuff that is incoherent and/or unproductive<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I believe this to be important: commitment is necessary to get somewhere, and aimlessly going from one place to the other is detrimental to our growth, be it spiritual or not. Vajrayana (atleast Vividness&rsquo; version) seems consistent enough to satisfy those of us that are spiritually hungry yet anti-spiritual and fond of coherence, while at the same time refraining to having a say on anything about ethics, politics, etc. (beyond its tendency to call out the <a href="https://meaningness.com/nebulosity">nebulosity of reality</a>, and thus prevent us to take any position/system/map too seriously, without rejecting its possible usefulness).</p>
<p>I use the word <code>worldview</code>, even though it&rsquo;s a branch of Buddhism, a religion, because of all the semantical weight the word <code>religion</code> carries. I don&rsquo;t like a tradition to tell me what is good and bad, nor having to wrestle with a set of fantasies that my brain cannot accept, such as afterlife, heaven and hell, causality, and such. Vajrayana is still a religion, though.</p>
<p>For the same reason, I use the word <code>Vajrayana</code> and not <code>Buddhism</code>: Buddhism in the west is associated with stuff such as karma, niceness, and a particular moral rigidity. I don&rsquo;t believe in karma<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, <a href="/posts/essays/ripping">definitely don&rsquo;t think being nice is the way-to-go at all times</a>, and acting as if there is a proper way to act at all times is <a href="https://meaningness.com/ethical-eternalism">naive</a>. Vajrayana is still Buddhism, it just differs so much from what is currently understood as so.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s to like about Vajrayana then?</p>
<p>I think the main value it provides is a particular predisposition towards reality. Let me explain:</p>
<p>Vajrayana is built on top of something, which is the concept of <em>emptiness</em>. In practical terms, emptiness is the realization that stuff (emotions, actions, thoughts) lack inherent meanings. From there, another realization arises: we are free from specific patterns of response, we are free to choose<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when Vajrayana starts getting really interesting: it focuses on what David Chapman refers as &ldquo;maintaining an attitude&rdquo;, and supplies a set of practices that help out with the maintainance or deployment of that attitude.</p>
<p>This attitude is referred to as <a href="https://vividness.live/tantra-base"><em>spacious passion</em></a>, which is something akin to having the experiential understanding that things don&rsquo;t have to go a specific way, and acting from there with a bias towards connecting and creating, which usually lead to enjoyment. We can do this already (base), and it is what we want to keep on doing, maybe even better and more consistently (goal).</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going bullet-point-y on a set of affirmations that stem from the description above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoyment is frequently caused by connecting and creating: with people and with the world.</li>
<li>Passion promotes connection.</li>
<li>Passion possesses strong energy<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which can lead us to act in a specific, fixed way. Spaciousness (a more affirming, less confusing way of talking about emptiness) solves that, by being a kind of reminder of the vast space of possibility that there is at any given moment.</li>
<li>Sometimes it is the other way around: things get zombie-y and more passion is what is needed.</li>
<li>So, Tantra&rsquo;s<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> path is all about unclogging energy so we can keep on delivering this spacious passion. What this means is that it provides tools that help deploying passion or spaciousness when they are lacking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perception and action have a preference over thinking and feeling. Thoughts and feelings lack inherent meanings (are empty), and so they don&rsquo;t have to get in the way deploying the attitude.</li>
<li>Meditation methods such as <a href="https://www.amazon.es/dp/B0CL5QH5DV?linkCode=gg2&amp;tag=meaningness-20">Opening Awareness</a> are meant to help us get familiarized with the spaciousness I was talking about earlier. Meditating is not necessary as it is not the goal, but it can be useful as the more familiarized you are with spaciousness, the easier it is to deploy it.</li>
<li>A rejection towards emotions is a usual cause of reactivity (of fixed patterns of response). Embracing our emotions leads to an increase of the intensity we can tolerate, which means that we get used to feeling the whole thing without letting our emotions choose for us. <a href="https://vajrayananow.com/spectrum-of-ecstasy">We can even use the passion those emotions carry for our own advantage</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that this is not specific to Vajrayana: any system of meaning wil be able to deliver a set of ideas that you can use as reference point. Also, you can say that reference points are not needed, and that might be fair. At this current moment though, I find it impossible to disembed my beliefs from a specific culture/context. If you ask me why I would choose Vajrayana over any other woldview, then, my response is simple: I just find Vajrayana&rsquo;s aesthetics attractive.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>By karma I mean the idea that if you do good things, good things will happen to you (and viceversa). I reject causality at the universe level (&ldquo;I was nice to this person, so the universe will pay me back eventually&rdquo;), which doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t believe that if you behave like a dick, people will respond in a probably-not-nice way to you.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>That is not to say that we create our own realities: we are bound by the affordances the specific circumstances we are part of provides.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>If you are like me, you probably feel disgust towards the word <code>energy</code>. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that there is no better word to refer to it, but when I speak of energy, I mean <strong>the movement of emotions in the body</strong>. Nothing else.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>I have been talking about Vajrayana until now, that I just mentioned Tantra. That&rsquo;s because Vajrayana is comprised of two different-enough worldviews: Tantra and Dzogchen. I&rsquo;m not going to go deep on this, but a basic explanation would be that Dzogchen says that &ldquo;all is well as it is&rdquo;, so it doesn&rsquo;t provide tools to change anything. Tantra doesn&rsquo;t think that, so it does provide tools to transform states. I use the word &lsquo;Vajrayana&rsquo;, then, because Vividness has the view Dzogchen has of all being well, yet embraces the tools Tantra provides because they are helpful (this is still Dzogchen&rsquo;s view: it recognizes the role other Buddhisms play <em>(remember principles and functions?)</em>, and recurs to them when they can resort useful for a given scenario).&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
