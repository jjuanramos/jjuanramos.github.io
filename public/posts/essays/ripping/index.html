			<p>This is a post I wrote a few months ago about the responsibility we have to be open to feedback. After reading Cate Hall&rsquo;s piece about <a href="https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/are-you-a-jerk-or-a-liar">community-seekers vs truth-seekers</a>, I can see how the whole purpose of this post is written from a community-seeker/connection-above-truth worldview, where it is assumed that conflict equals trouble.</p>
<p>If I were to write it again, I would focus on how being kind is actually different from being nice, and that real kindness requires saying stuff that might hurt the other (getting away as much as possible from being a jerk, of course), as the whole motif of being kind is caring about the others&rsquo; wellbeing.</p>
<p>I would also highlight what Cate emphasizes in the title of her essay: that, when facing conflict or tension, one can choose to risk being a jerk or accept being a liar. I have more experience on the latter, as it is a tendency I have, and I can say this: lying and saying all is good risks building resentment towards the other, so it&rsquo;s not a free lunch either.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict doesn&rsquo;t mean screaming and drama</strong>, even if some of us have that relationship subconsciously built deep within. It requires a tolerance to strong emotions, though.</p>
<p>Good news is, that is totally workable. I personally recommend the book <a href="https://www.brucetift.com/already-free-book/">Already Free by Bruce Tift</a>: its exercises and his connection/separability thesis (similar to Cate Hall&rsquo;s truth-seeking/community-seeking) actually made a change in how I approach conflict (that is, I no longer run by default).</p>
<p>Having said that, <a href="https://participes.substack.com/p/ripping-each-other-open">here&rsquo;s the original essay</a>.</p>
