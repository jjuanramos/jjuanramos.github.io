      <description>This is a short story inspired by the cover of Robert Kegan&amp;rsquo;s book The Evolving Self.&#xA;At the time, I was struggling with how one can resolve the tension between being and becoming, between accepting oneself while at the same time striving to be something more.&#xA;What came out is death, repulsion, and transformation, amidst a landscape where the possibility of blood is ever present.&#xA;Anyways! Here&amp;rsquo;s the piece, hope you like it :).</description>
