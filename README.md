This is the project that I developed in order to complete my Bachelor at the Polytechnic Unversity of Valencia. It's done with R, shiny, bookdown & Python.

The code could be better written, better structured and more optimized, but at the time I didn't know better.
On the same note, the text could be in English, I reckon. It would have been a smarter choice.

Someday, maybe, I will tackle those issues. For now, you can access the finished work [here](https://jjuanramos.github.io/).
