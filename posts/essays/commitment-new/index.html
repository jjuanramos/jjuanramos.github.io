			<p>Nowadays, I am starting to see commitment as the practice of letting go of the fantasy of utter certainty: that we&rsquo;re ever going to find something that fully satisfies us, leaving no room for doubt.</p>
<p>I, too, am skeptical of reason: I grew out of love with it during my early-twenties, when I started to realize that conceptualization was just another way of apprehending reality -not the ultimate, but rather an useful tool with its own trade-offs-.</p>
<p>In fact, even though I recognized how reason could be useful for decision-making on paper, on practice I would go all-in on instinct<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: where my gut points to, there shall I go. If reason wasn&rsquo;t capable of solving this deep unsatisfaction, then instinct just might. Reason would then be reduced to intelectually justify the decision that was made on a whim in the first place.</p>
<p>Thus, the past few years have consisted of me exploring anything and everything: nothing intrinsically bad about that, yet I can&rsquo;t help but recognize how deeply confused the underlying force that moved me was. Basically, what I didn&rsquo;t have shone brighter on its potentiality than anything I possessed, whose shadows were casted by the light of actuality: of what is and isn&rsquo;t, and, more importantly, might just never become.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something valuable that is coming out of that exploration, and that might sound nihilistic, sad, and worrying to some.</p>
<p>And that is a sense of hopelessness: there&rsquo;s not something waiting for me to discover that will transform reality into something more vivid, brighter, and meaningful. Nor will I ever stop questioning the choices I made: stuff will sometimes look more attractive on the other side. At the end, there is nothing beyong what is: this is it.</p>
<p>However, hopelessness seems like a fertile ground to build on top of: it provides serenity and sobriety, a way of seeing things-as-they-are that can lead to conducive acting.</p>
<p>From this ground, there&rsquo;s something I am starting to appreciate: that depth provides mastery, and mastery provides enjoyment. And that, at the same time, impulsiveness can be an enemy in the quest of pursuing depth.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m starting to see commitment lately: a willingness to recognize that we are not mandated to act on every feeling and emotion, and that we can choose. That we can be skeptical towards the idea that instinct carries a deeper, more profound meaning.</p>
<p>Truth be told, feelings are overrated: they are not our true selves, nor do they convey something deep within. They can provide information, but, at the end of the day, they are just that: feelings. There&rsquo;s no need to reify them, not even to express them at all times. There&rsquo;s nothing we must do with them, basically. Anxiety does not force us to become dysfunctional, nor joy to be stupid; FOMO doesn&rsquo;t mean you should go to that party<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: feelings are feelings, and they are here to be felt. In fact, one could argue that, often, impulsiveness is a reaction that stems from a rejection towards actually feeling what must be felt<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. What I&rsquo;m saying here is that you don&rsquo;t have to act based on your feelings. I don&rsquo;t have a clue about who you are, but your feelings definitely ain&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>Commitment seems like a predisposition to re-ground, to reason when it&rsquo;s useful, and ask: is this actually true?</p>
<p>The point of commitment is not a blind faith towards what is, but a healthy skepticism towards what could be. Might wanna give it a shot.</p>
<p>I was skeptical of reason, and now I&rsquo;m skeptical of instinct and feelings, too. If you want to know what I will become skeptical of in the future, please subscribe.</p>
<p>tl;dr:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>turns 27 years old, realizes the potential he had at 21 has remained unexploited due to constant back-and-forth with possibilities
sees how constant back-and-forth is leading nowhere
sees commitment as the way out: choices have been made by us for us, and we don&rsquo;t change them. we remain choiceless for as long as we can
profit?</p>
